# Slama slides into a win at the Casey Stoner Cup

After a few years hiatus to focus on Motocross and Supercross, Sam returned the track where he raced his first flat track meet back in 2008, the Kurri Kurri Junior Motorcycle Club. A track with a long history of producing some of the countries best racers, and races.

The main reason for the return was to give his little brother the same initiation as both Sam, and his brother Rhys had in the past, maiden voyages in the Casey Stoner Cup. Sam's first race here was as an 8 year old Division 2 rider, Rhys was the following year as a 7 year old, Tommi armed with a Yamaha PW50, made his race debut as a 5 year old, the one thing all 3 boys had in common at their very first races they rode in, they loved.

Sam, in what was possibly his last race at Kurri as a junior, played a big part in Tommi's day and helped him out where he could. Tommi rode very cautiously and was hit hard by a flying ktm at the end of practice sending both boys to the ground hard, after a few tears, Tommi walked off the track, already talking about his next 'race'.

Sam also had the pressure on him, as both his little brothers, Tommi and Charlie, idolize him, and had already told Sam they expected nothing less than the best. Sam's bike was still set up for supercross and he was more than happy just to be another competitor until the little fella's upped the ante and wanted to see him up the front.

He looked good in practice aboard his Maitland Motorcycles, Port Tune Performance prepared RM85, but practice can be deceiving, especially if the fast guys get caught up with slower riders or an accident. But when the gate dropped in race 1 and Sam rocketed out of the gate and into the first turn with the lead, all bets were off, he ran wide in turn 2 and let fellow competitor and full time track rider, Angus Hutchinson, to make a move up the inside, Sam followed for the next few laps using his motocross skill to try and mount an attack, but the different disciplines means different line choices, and Sam's tight entries into corners were costing him corner exit speed. He had it worked out by the last lap and was able to close the gap, but not get the pass made. Lesson learnt, Sam knew what needed.

After a few suspension changes and a gearing change, Sam helped his brother to the line for his Nipper 'race',  after his accident in practice, Tommi was unfazed and as keen as ever.  And went about his business with little fuss all day long, and provided a nice distraction for Sam not to think about the racing too much, or the heat.

Race 2 and 3 were very similar, the gearing change and suspension adjustments really paid off, Sam wasn't challenged out of the gate and rode away to win fairly easily, he had his corner entries dialled, and was really enjoying himself on the track.

Race 4 and again, Sam was like a bullet out of the gate, but, like race 1, he ran wide into turns 1 and 2 and Angus was there to take advantage of the mistake and made the pass, the boys battled and swapped positions for the remainder of the race, with Sam losing the front end out of the last turn, allowing Angus taking the win.

Going into the final race, Sam had the hopes and dreams of two demanding little fans on his shoulders, he was lined up on the outside gate, and knew he only needed 3rd or better for the overall. Slama got another great jump off the concrete and sped out of the gates and into turn 1 with a comfortable 2 bike length lead already, he was able to checkout within a lap and controlled the race from the front, winning quite easily and taking the overall, the elusive Casey Stoner Cup was finally crossed off the bucket list. He was happy with he days racing and progress made with the bikes set up, and his brothers were over the moon with his victory.
