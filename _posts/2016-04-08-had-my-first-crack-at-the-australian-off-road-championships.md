description: "Had my first crack at the Australian Off Road Championships on the weekend and surprised myself, once I was in front of my class I tried to improve my outright position and got myself in trouble, had a decent crash on Saturday during the first round and lost a lot of time, felt I was getting close to the front again, and in the last run I got a flat front tyre, and then crashed trying to keep a fast pace but was good enough for 2nd, Round 2 on Sunday started well, and small mistake cost me around 30 seconds, charged for the rest of the day and was able to get the round win by 18 seconds over 2nd place. Cannot wait for the next rounds, I'll be way better prepared and have a better understanding of how I need to ride. Best wishes to Ned Chapman who had a nasty spill on Sunday, speedy recovery mate! Thanks to all my family for believing in me and Mum and Dad for all the hours behind the wheel, I'd be no where without any of you. And to Tommi for the biggest welcome home ever, it actually hurt lol Thank you to all my sponsors for your help and support, I have the best crew in my corner this year and am very grateful and hope to return the favor with some good results throughout the year.
