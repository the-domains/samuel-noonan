# Slama takes the top spot at Jimboomba Stadium Cross

Beautiful weather and a large crowd were on hand for the Stadium Cross at Hills College in Jimboomba, the Maitland Motorcycle's backed rider had a cautious run in qualifying, just 12 days earlier Sam found himself lying in a hospital bed after a big crash at Cessnock's Keith Allen Classic in the 250 class left him concussed, battered and bruised, and very lucky to escape serious injury.

In practice two of the classes front runners found themselves hitting the ground hard, and out the night's racing. Sam gained confidence everytime he hit the track on the 85, however just couldn't get comfortable on the bike that threw him just a few weeks earlier, and used his ride in the junior lites class to gain more track time. Poor starts hindered his qualifying efforts, but that didn't stop coming through the pack, narrowly missing out on the win in his second heat race after a lapped rider got inbetween he and Mason Rowe in the whoop section, allowing Rowe to get a cleaner run, and just pipping Sam at the finish line. All in all he was happy to have qualified 5th in the 85 class, and into the 'A' Final.

The sun was going down as they lined up for the final, qualifying 5th meant that Sam had 5th pick of the gate, he opted to line up on the far outside for the left handed first turn, his main competition was on the inside, the gate dropped and he got off to a great start, positioned himself well around the first corner and was in third position heading into turn number 2, he wasted little time onto the back wheel of Rowe's Ktm85, making the pass up the inside at the end of the opening lap, the KTM85 of Tyler Darby was next, Sam rode the next 2 laps faultlessly, pulling up on Darby on lap 3, Tyler made a small mistake out of turn 2 and allowed Sam's RM85 to pull along side him down the rythym section where Sam was able to stay lower over the jumps, making the pass stick by turn 3, from there Sam did what he needed to do and pulled a few bike lengths, on the final lap a crashed rider brought out the yellow flag down the same section Sam had passed Tyler a few laps earlier, the yellow flag worked in Darby's favour and he was able to close the gap right up, with one turn to go they were side by side with Sam controlling the inside around the final turn, that was all he needed to be able to get through the whoop section and over the finish line double, lighting the candles as he greeted the chequered flag with a fist pump.

He was stoked to have turned in his day around, 'from qualifying 5th, to winning the final, was a great feeling, have to thank all my sponsors for all their support, really happy to have done this for myself and them, big thanks to Maitland Motorcycles, Greef Clothing, Nectar Sunglasses, my parents for driving me up here, the boys for the competiton and Scott Bannan for putting on another awesome event, thank you'.

Sam then lined up for the 'B' final in the junior lites aboard his RMZ250, full of confidence from his win in the 85 class, he started at the rear and worked his way through the pack, leading from the third lap to take a commanding lead, easily winning.
